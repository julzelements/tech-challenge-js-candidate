# TShirt Ventures tech exercise

Hey! Congrats on the interview progress!

This is a quick intro to the next stage.

You will be pairing with Julian and Alan for a 1 hour session.
Together, we will build a simple little invoice processor.

This is not a test to see how much syntax you know. If you get stuck, ask us for help. If you forget a built-in javascript function, just google it. Heck, we that every day right?

We are focusing on two things:
Can you collaborate?
Can you code?

You can demonstrate good collaboration by:

- Sharing your thoughts and thinking the problem out aloud.
- Asking clarifying questions to make sure you are building the correct thing.
- Being humble and cooperative.

You can demonstrate good coding ability by:

- Knowing your way around your IDE.
- Debugging and fixing your code as you go.
- Breaking the problem into small solvable chunks.
- Writing tests.

Let's go into this together with an open mind. A good interview is like a frank exchange of ideas, we can both learn something from each other. This is a great opportunity for you to see what it's like to work with us too! There aren't many things that get built here without some collaboration. 😀
